This all started with me trying to learn what Github is and how version control works.

### Who Am I?

I'd rather not say because the internet is forever. I bet you could find out easily enough. I am a programming/coding hobbyist who doesn't have the patience or willpower to actually learn anything beyond a superficial level. I just copy and paste from Stack Overflow/Exchange and Google things until it does what I want it to.

I will probably be back later today, but for now I need to do the thing I'm paid for.



Goodbye
