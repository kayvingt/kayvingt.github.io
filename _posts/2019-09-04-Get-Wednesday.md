What? WHAT DID I SAY?

### Bring Back Peanut Butter Ripples

I am not aware of today.
It's happening to me and I am happening to it.
I have statements that are now outside menus.
Does that make them less real or did I forget them?  

<br>

You can't take back the first thing you didn't think about after the fact.  

<br>

With this spell, I can make mountains but I can't make the first batch of mountains of mountains of mountains of mutants.
The first batch of mutants was sticky and uncomfortable, but the last batch was dry and irresponsible.
To be sure.   

<br>

Hot and dry like the inside of my brain on a Wednesday morning.

<br>

Give me those Clockwork eyes. The orange eyes.

<br>

Give me two tall glasses of milk, hold the milk.

<br>

Soft teeth.

<br>


Bags of ice cream and a bottle of rosemary water that won't stop after the first time the time you found the first time.

<br>

Beget or begone but don't.

<br>

The lines will not have color. You can't see it but I can and I will but I will.

<br>

Wake me when I sleep. I sleep now so that later on I won't sleep.
It is a strategy recommended by 10 out of 10 dental hygienists.
They can't all be wrong. If they were all wrong we would not have a big net to fall back on.
The net would be some cheap colender made of twigs and lying mud.
Don't lie in the mud. You could get mud.

<br>

Give water now. Give said the little stream. Give oh give. Give oh give. Give said the little stream.
As it hurried down the hill.
I'm small I know but wherever I go the grass grows greener still.
Giving giving all the way. Give away oh give away.
Laughing singing all the day. Give oh give away.

Goodbye
