title: I Know We Can Make It

We're on our own.

### Dropping Pennies

A sludge.  
A fast.  
Oh where.  
There where.  
Too where.  
Ware.  
Fight on.  
We can go.  
Together.  
Hold on.  
Blow your nose.  

<br>

You could always right a book.  
The book will not fit on the shelf.  
Do not adjust the shelf. It is im·per·a·tive that you do not adjust the shelf.  
Look to your left. Now look to your right. I'm sorry the light is so bright.


<br>

Please continue.  
Terrible.  
It's the fucking pennies.

<br>

Goodbye
