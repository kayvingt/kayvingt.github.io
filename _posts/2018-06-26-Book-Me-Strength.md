Everything is a red line.

### I Can See Myself

I am not detached from the reality of my thoughts.
I can hear myself thinking very clearly. 
It's unpleasant and slow.
Treacle. Bad Treacle.

<br>

It's only Tuesday but it feels like a Thursday.I'm ready for the weekend and ready for lunch.
Is anyone ever not ready for lunch? 
Can you be taken by surprise by a feral lunch that has been stalking you since you woke up?

<br>

I can't get this song out of my head. Butterfly twice as high in the sky in a book.  
Now my coffee is gone. It's gone and the red line is broad.
I feel quietly desperate because I haven't seen the newest Star Wars movie in the theater.
If I don't see this one then I have set a precedent. I like movies. I want movies. I want a Star War.

<br>

Goodbye
