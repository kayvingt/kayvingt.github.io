title: We Back We Bad We Bon't

It's too salty for my lips

### BIG LETTERS

Self control.  
Control self.  
Shelf patrol.  
Bad health.  
What would you like me to say to you?  
I'll say it.  
What would you like me to do?  
I'll try and fail to do it.  
I can't be good at something unless it's very easy to do.  
Hard things are too hard.  

<br>

It isn't good to be so bad but I am bad and that's not good.  
If you read a book and it's a bad book but only after page 100 is that book still a bad book or is it just a book that starts off good before it gets bad and if that's not good would you still like that book or is it too bad to be good and you wouldn't like that book?
Either way it's a book but books are garbage and we should all die.  
Books are garbage and we like to hurt things and build garbage out of other garbage to make more garbage and be sad.

<br>

If you're reading this than the end has come and we are all dead.  
Haha just kidding if you are reading this I've sent it to you in a link and pretended that I think it's silly fun times and that your opinion won't have a significant effect on my self image.  
Do the woah.  
Woad.  
The Woad Warrior.  
Oh shit did I just create a movie where Mel Gibson fights the English crown in the Thunderdome?  
I accomplished something today. I can die now. 

<br>

Goodbye
