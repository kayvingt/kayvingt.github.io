### Mind the Gap

The formula will make a cake.  
The cake has jam in it.  
Strawbrary at the lawbrary.  
Flickering.  
If I had to guess I would guess that you are tired of this. I don't blame you. 
I am tired of this too. 
I'd rather write something instead of writing nothing. However, nothing comes to mind. So I mind.  
I pick over a thought like I'm a child who hates. Truncate your thoughts and filter your stewing it.

<br>

Please begin again.  
This time do it better. Be better and feel better and have much many more better.

<br>

I can't lift myself. I can lift myself. The spirit was lifted and twisted into a major donut. Zoo aquired.  
Locked on target. All systems nominal. Ghost Bear.

Jet packs trilling as you fly over a dome.
The dome has a detective in it and they are on to you. They know your game and they will stop you.  
Not long now.  
Not long now.  
Cold. Don't drop your glasses. They may break and then the robots will find you in the rain.  
We can't have rainy robots roving rapidly.
That's how you get Roman doors.
Roamin' and a hollerin' and a wailin'.

<br>

Goodbye
