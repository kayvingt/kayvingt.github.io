### Fast Like Mustard

<br>

There are good reasons to lose sleep and there are not good reasons to lose sleep.  
As a person who doesn't get enough sleep it's usually for a stupid reason. So stupid.  
It's the thread that hasn't left, it trails back behind me for almost two decades now.  
I can barely see the beginning.
It's the most stupid, the best stupid. The real stupid.
This plum flavored gum doesn't taste like anything anymore. I still like to chew on it.  
God of the sea and minty freshness.  
Some things don't bear thinking about. Bears thinking about bears. Bears baring baby bjorns bemusedly but bothered by bisons.  
I need to take my medicine. I take some but not others and not always but usually except lately.
It's too quiet now. Ring out wild bells in my head zombie.

<br>

Goodbye
