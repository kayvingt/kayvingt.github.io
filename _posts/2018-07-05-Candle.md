There is a hole in the bottom of the well.

### Face It

It's slow time. It's slow. Time. It is. Slow.
I wish I had more of the fast time it is fast time it.

<br>

Remember the day after corn cobs and bag pipes?
Fish. Fish more.
Get fish more.
First.

<br>

No doubt reality is poking holes in this curtain.
My arm hurts.
A beedle dump aye. EEEEEEEDLE

<br>

Goodbye
