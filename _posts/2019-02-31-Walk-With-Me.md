This will be my final transmission

### Little Noises

Do you hear the little noises?  
It's the sound of impending oblivion.  
A little song, a good song.  
So sweet.  

<br>

I will die and that's okay.  
Today I lived and went away.  

<br>

Nothing left.  
It's always there.  
Can't feel myself.  
I hear it now.  
It's always there.  
Can't flush it out.  
Just forget it's there.  
Little noises.  
So little.  
So little.  

<br>

Goodbye
